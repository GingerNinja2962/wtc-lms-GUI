# wtc-lms-GUI
This is a GUI for wtc-lms, using subprocess calls and pysimplegui to provide a smooth GUI application like feel for your wtc-lms command line tool.

## Requirements
 - Linux based system (as windows cannot run the wtc-lms tool commands).
 - A pre installed and setup wtc-lms commandline tool (this program works off the original wtc-lms command line tool and thus needs that tool to run any wtc-lms related commands).
 - The newest version of python3 with pip3.


## Install
from within the folder wtc-lms-GUI run:

sudo bash installer.sh


## Usage
from with in the folder wtc-lms-GUI run:

wtc-lms login
 - this is to login in to wtc-lms allowing the program to access wtc-lms commands

./lms
 - This starts the wtc-lms-GUI program
